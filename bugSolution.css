The issue can be solved by ensuring the `.container` element has a defined `position` property, usually `relative`, creating a new stacking context, and allowing the absolutely positioned pseudo-element to properly layer on top.  Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.container {
  position: relative; /* This is the key change */
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: lightcoral; 
}
```
By adding `position: relative;` to `.container`, the `::before` pseudo-element is correctly layered, and the `background-color: lightcoral` is displayed as expected.
